    "# This notebook is an introduction to a security and optimization tool for symbiote systems: Symbiote's IPC server\n",
    "\n",
    "One of my contributions to the Symbiote project is what we call the IPC server. Normally, symbiote system users might think that any application entering a risky “elevated” state is unsafe and concerning. \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this is our IPC server: a single centralized approved application that runs in a proven-to-be-safe elevated state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a user application would like to perform a shortcutted system call, our ipc interposer library transparently intercepts a normal system call and sends a request through shared memory to the ipc server. The server, in turn, performs the shortcutted version of the system call and returns the result back to the user application.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model allows a whitelisted admin-approved symbiote application running in an elevated supervisor mode transparently improve performance and efficiency of other applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, this approach is ABI compatible, meaning no code modifications are required for original binaries of user applications!"
